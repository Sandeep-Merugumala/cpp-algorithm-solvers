# C++ Algorithm Solvers

This monorepo contains a collection of classic C++ implementations of popular algorithm-based solvers:

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. [Grid Pathfinding using BFS](grid-pathfinding-bfs/)
A 5x5 grid navigation solver using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from start to goal avoiding obstacles.

### 2. [8 Puzzle Solver using IDDFS](8-puzzle-iddfs-solver/)
Solves the 8-puzzle problem using Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) with puzzle solvability validation and step-wise move tracking.

### 3. [4x4 Sudoku Solver using Backtracking](4x4-sudoku-solver/)
Backtracking-based solver for 4x4 Sudoku puzzles, including input validation and structured output.
